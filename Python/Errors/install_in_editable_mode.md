# Full error message PEP 660

ERROR: Project file:///home/stroming/dev/github/onyx/onyx-dp-nlp-berlin-api has a 'pyproject.toml' and its build backend is missing the 'build_editable' hook. Since it does not have a 'setup.py' nor a 'setup.cfg', it cannot be installed in editable mode. Consider using a build backend that supports PEP 660.

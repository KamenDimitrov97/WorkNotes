# Elasticsearch 

Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine designed for handling large amounts of data. It provides a search API for querying data and storing, managing, and analyzing that data in near real-time. Elasticsearch can be used for various use cases such as full-text search, performance analysis, and logging, among others.


Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database that is built on top of the Apache Lucene library, which provides efficient indexing and search capabilities. It is highly scalable, meaning it can handle large amounts of data and handle high traffic loads by distributing the data and search load across multiple nodes. Additionally, it provides a REST API for communication and data management, allowing it to be easily integrated with other systems and applications.

Elasticsearch also supports real-time search and analytics, which makes it a popular choice for applications that require fast search and data retrieval. It also has a flexible data model, allowing data to be stored in various formats, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Additionally, it provides built-in support for distributed search and analytics, so that users can perform complex search and analysis across multiple indices and nodes.

Overall, Elasticsearch is a highly performant and flexible technology that is widely used for a variety of use cases, ranging from website search to log analysis and more.


you can use elasticsearch templates to build one big json query to elasticsearch 
but if you make multiple templates they should reference eachother hierarchically

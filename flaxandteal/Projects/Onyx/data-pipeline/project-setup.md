# As a developer I need to create an easy way to setup and run the project, so that each change to the apis I make can tested easily 

# Possible tasks

1. Setup api-router 
1. Setup search-reindex-api
1. Setup zebedee - have it setup 
1. Setup dataset API
1. Setup search-data-finder 
1. Setup search-data-extractor
1. Setup search-data-importer
1. Setup search-reindex-tracker  -- most likely not going to work on it
1. create a dp-compose file to start the whole project


# Estimates:

I think I can set the whole thing up in a 6 days -- this will be kept 


# DP-api-router

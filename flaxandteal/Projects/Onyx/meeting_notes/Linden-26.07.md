# Most important thing is that you need:

1. Root variable called zebedee_root="full/path/to/zebedee-cms/zebedee"
2. setup the whole stack, there's a step by step guide: https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-compose/tree/main/v2/stacks/search
3. and this works I managed to set it up and start up florence with the whole stack running 
only issue is that the create/update dataset feature(the one we needed ) is broken and doesn't work 

investigating

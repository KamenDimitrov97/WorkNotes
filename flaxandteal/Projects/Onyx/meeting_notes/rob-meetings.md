scheduled for friday

data is stored in a open data platform not main website, 
there's complications that they're dealing with in ESS, deliverd in a subdomain 
we're using some of that to reuse the data, won
json format metadata payload
geographic breakdown - 

can use spraql, andrew ferguson, 

ESS:
geographic info not used in ONS website, but datasets are present (often as XLS)
as json-ld metadata payload, CSV-W - not (yet) linked into normal ONS website datastores
for this phase, would need to copy and use a static dump of the data
can get access via sparql or https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph

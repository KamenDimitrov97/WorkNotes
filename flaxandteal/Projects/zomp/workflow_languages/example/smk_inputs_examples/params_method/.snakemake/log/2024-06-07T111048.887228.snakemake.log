MissingOutputException in rule all in file /home/kamen/notes/workNotes/flaxandteal/Projects/zomp/workflow_languages/example/smk_inputs_examples/params_method/Snakefile, line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/processed_data.txtdata/processed_data2.txt (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message

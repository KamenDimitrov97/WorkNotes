# Features
1. Use of wildcards.
1. Config file for parameterization.
1. Rule chaining with dependencies.
1. Shell commands and Python scripts.
1. Input functions.
1. Log files.
1. Conditional statements.
1. Dynamic outputs.
1. We'll build a workflow that processes sequencing data through multiple steps: downloading data, quality control, trimming, alignment, and generating summary statistics.

Explanation of Key Snakemake Features
Config File: Parameters are loaded from config.yaml to make the workflow flexible and easy to modify.
Wildcards: Used to dynamically generate file paths based on sample names.
Rule Dependencies: Each rule depends on the outputs of previous rules, forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
Input Functions: Used to generate input file paths based on the sample names.
Scripts: Python scripts are called to perform tasks, demonstrating how to integrate custom code.
Shell Commands: Simulated with echo commands for illustration, but can be replaced with actual data processing commands.
Logging and Error Handling: Can be added to the shell directive using log files.
Running the Workflow
Run the workflow with the following command:

sh
Copy code
snakemake --cores 4
This command tells Snakemake to execute the workflow using 4 cores. The workflow will handle downloading data, performing quality control, trimming reads, aligning reads, and generating a summary report for each sample, leveraging the advanced features of Snakemake.





start with a very small snakemake 

the idea is that basically you can write - the poinmt is that you can write a dynamic workflow and you can render it statically using dewret into many diff workflow languages

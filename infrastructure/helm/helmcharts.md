Helm Charts:

Helm charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources that can be easily deployed and managed. They encapsulate applications, services, or components along with their dependencies, making it easier to distribute, version, and deploy complex applications in Kubernetes.

Common Helm Chart Commands:
1. `helm install`: Deploys a Helm chart to a Kubernetes cluster, creating a new release of the specified application.
1. `helm upgrade`: Upgrades an existing Helm release with changes from a new version of the chart or modified configuration values.
1. `helm rollback`: Rolls back a release to a previous version, undoing changes made by an upgrade.
1. `helm uninstall`: Deletes a Helm release and its associated resources from the Kubernetes cluster.
1. `helm list`: Lists all the installed Helm releases along with their statuses.
1. `helm fetch`: Downloads a chart without installing it, useful for inspecting its contents before deployment.
1. `helm show values`: Displays the default values and configurable options for a Helm chart.
1. `helm package`: Packages a directory containing a Helm chart into a versioned archive (tgz) file for distribution.
1. `helm dependency update`: Updates the dependencies of a Helm chart based on the information in the requirements.yaml file.
1. `helm template`: Renders the Kubernetes manifest files for a Helm chart without installing or deploying it.
1. `helm lint`: Checks the syntax and structure of a Helm chart's files and configuration.

Helm charts streamline the process of deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes by providing a standardized way to package, distribute, and configure complex workloads. The commands above allow you to install, upgrade, and manage Helm releases, making it easier to work with Kubernetes applications in a consistent manner.
